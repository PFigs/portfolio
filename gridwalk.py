# Description:
#	There is a monkey which can walk around on a planar grid. 
#	The monkey can move one space at a time left, right, up or down. 
#	That is, from (x, y) the monkey can go to (x+1, y), (x-1, y), 
#	(x, y+1), and (x, y-1). Points where the sum of the digits of the 
#	absolute value of the x coordinate plus the sum of the digits of 
#	the absolute value of the y coordinate are lesser than or equal to
#	19 are accessible to the monkey. For example, the point (59, 79) 
#	is inaccessible because 5 + 9 + 7 + 9 = 30, which is greater than 
#	19. Another example: the point (-5, -7) is accessible because 
#	abs(-5) + abs(-7) = 5 + 7 = 12, which is less than 19. How many 
#	points can the monkey access if it starts at (0, 0), 
#	including (0, 0) itself?
#
# Input sample:
#	There is no input for this program.
#
# Output sample:
#	Print the number of points the monkey can access. 
#	It should be printed as an integer â€” for example, if the number of 
#	points is 10, print "10", not "10.0" or "10.00", etc.
